            <img src="./main.jpg" class="wide-image" alt="Wayne Rooney">
            <p><b>Wayne Rooney will face his former side Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup after Derby beat Northampton in their fourth-round replay.</b></p>

            <p>Holders Manchester City, will travel to Sheffield Wednesday.</p>

            <p> Chelsea will host Liverpool after they overcame Shrewsbury in a replay, while Arsenal travel to League One Portsmouth.</p>

            <p> All eight ties will be played across three midweek nights from 3-5 March.</p>

            <p> Rooney, who is United and England's all-time record goalscorer, joined Championship club Derby County as a player-coach in January from MLS side DC United.</p>

            <p>Now 34, he played 559 times for United, scoring 253 goals.</p>

            <p>He won five Premier League titles and each of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup once after joining from Everton for Â£27m in 2004.</p>

            <p>Since leaving Old Trafford he has faced his former employers twice, losing both games during the 2017-18 season, while in a second spell at Everton.</p>

            <p>Tottenham are at home to Norwich after beating Southampton in the final replay of the season.</p>

            <p>Why are fifth-round ties being played in midweek?
            In a change to the usual format, all eight ties will be played across three midweek nights from 3-5 March, with no replays.</p>

            <p>If any of the ties are level after 90 minutes there will be 30 minutes of extra time and, if necessary, penalties to determine a winner on the night.</p>

            <p>It is the second season running that fifth-round replays have been removed from the competition in an attempt to alleviate fixture congestion.</p>

            <p>In addition, the Premier League is having a mid-season break in February, with each team getting a weekend off.</p>
